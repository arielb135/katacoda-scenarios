In this task we will enable text files upload, while the application is still in air.

##Â Task

Edit the values yaml, and enable the files support

`demo/lets-chat/values.yaml`{{open}}

Change files_support enabled to ** true **:

```
# Should we support file upload?	
files_support:
  enabled: false
```

Upgrade the chart:

`helm upgrade lets-chat --name demo -f ./lets-chat/values.yaml`{{execute}}

Open the application again and see that now you are able to upload files

http://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30303-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com

The upgrade was unsuccessful from your end, let's rollback the change, see now that the files are not allowed:

`helm history demo`{{execute}}

`helm rollback demo 1`{{execute}}
