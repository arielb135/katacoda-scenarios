### Helm and Tiller

Helm - is a kubernetes package manager, several notes about it:
* Find and use popular software packaged as Helm charts to run in Kubernetes
* Share your own applications as Helm charts
* Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
* Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
* Manage releases of Helm packages

Tiller - Tiller is the in-cluster component of Helm. 
It interacts directly with the Kubernetes API server to install, upgrade, query, and remove Kubernetes resources. It also stores the objects that represent releases.
